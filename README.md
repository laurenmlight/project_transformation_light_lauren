## Resources
I did not use
any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

## Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this assignment and in the syllabus.

## Comments
This assignment was lengthy but I was able to get through it by following along closely with the lectures. I feel accomplished now that I'm finished, but there were a lot of components involved in working through it and submitting it completely. I wouldn't be surprised if I missed something, but I tried to be as thorough as possible!
